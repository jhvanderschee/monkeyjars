At l’Ozio you can enjoy North Italian cuisine. All meals are prepared in our own kitchen by our Italian chefs: from starters to mains, from pasta to dessert, all daily fresh handmade. We want to introduce you to the different flavors Italy has to offer with our food as well as with our wines. That is why we only use the best products from Italy and The Netherlands. For the true Italian experience we organize every evening an Aperitivo.

Ozio is derived from the Latin word ‘Otium’. Otium refers to leisure time in which a person enjoys eating, playing, resting, contemplation and academic endeavors. Oziare, the Italian verb, means to be free. Oziare means to have fun, pleasure, enjoying yourself.

We want to be lovers of idleness, Ozio, “dolce far niente”, with the freedom to choose a good wine that takes you to a foreign country, under unknown sun with a breeze of wind stroking your face. The freedom to choose a tasty dish that explodes in your mouth that makes you dream of green hills, snowy mountains and deep seas. Our goal is to create a place where you can lounge, drink, eat, in other words, a place where you can take time for YOU.

Our restaurant is situated in the heart of the Amsterdam area 'de Pijp'. At l'Ozio you can enjoy an extented lunch, dinner or just an aperitif or good glass of wine. We have a privat room perfect for meetings, group dinners or a privat party.&nbsp;
