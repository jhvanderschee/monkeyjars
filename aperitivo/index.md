EVERY THURSDAY: APERITIVO & LIVE MUSIC from 18.00 till 20.00

The APERITIVO is already a notion in the north of Italy, that why we now want to introduce you at l’Ozio to the ritual of the ‘pre-dinner drink and bite’. To tickle your appetite and give you the chance to socialize with friends, relax and have a little nibble before dinner. A little something to encourage you to feel hungry, to get the juices flowing, if you will, so you can fully enjoy your upcoming meal. Aperitivo should not be translated to English or Dutch. We should start saying, “Let’s go get an aperitivo” or “Prendiamo un aperitivo.”

Every Thursday evening we organize an Aperitivo at our restaurant in the Pijp with live music from jazz, funk to rocknroll. Check out our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/lozioamsterdam/) to see which band is performing this Thursday!

How does it work?
<br>We serve delicious Italian drinks like Aperol Spritz, Hugo and Americano for 10 euro per drink with free use of the buffet with Italian fingerfood!
